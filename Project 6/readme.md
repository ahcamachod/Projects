# Project 6

This project features cluster analysis to identify groups of similar characteristics within the FIFA 2019 dataset.

In order to do this, it is necessary to extract the most relevant features from the dataset and apply both 
a partitioning and hierarchical technique to obtain proper segmentation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
is used as well for visualization matters.

The purpose of this segmentation is to help a club manager identify players for his team.

Dataset used: FIFA 2019
