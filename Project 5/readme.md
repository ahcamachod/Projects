Linear Regression Challenge: Rick's Diamonds

This project has the objective of uploading a .csv file containing a prediction price of 5000 diamonds. 
The goal is exclusively to estimate the price of Rick’s 5000 diamonds achieving the smallest amount of error, 
so they can sell them properly.

The metric of success is, of course, money. Rick’s goal is to obtain an average error not greater than 950 dollars. 
The main objective is to create a prediction that will obtain a root mean squared error less than USD 950. 
A historical diamond dataset will be used generate the optimal regression model.
